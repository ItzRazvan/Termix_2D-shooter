# *Termix* - 2D shooter game

There are currently 4 stages and two weapons. Every stage, the enemies get tuffer and spawn faster. Every two stages, you get another weapon. Killed enemies drop heal potions that you can use, and
the map is infinite.

This was all made in *The C Programming Language*, and it was made for the Linux Terminal (it might not work on other operating systems).
